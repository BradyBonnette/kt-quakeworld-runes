     Here's a patch I've been working with to enhance the quality of
 deathmatch, and make it a little more interesting.

[    My Comments will be inclosed in brackets, like this statement.
[Nick did such a great job with the original, there is no need to rewrite
[the entire package for my simple modification. Cannon Fodder


 Description:
 -------------
     It's Quake deathmatching, but enhanced. You might have seen the runes in
 CTF.. I think they're a kick ass idea. I also play on an awesome multi-mod
 server written almost entirely by The Red Knight called SUPER_MODS! It also
 has some runes, but a few more, and more interesting ones. Well, I thought,
 what if I created a server where a HUGE variety of special runes that give
 different abilities were all over the level. So I created this. There's a
 number of runes all over the level. Sometimes new ones enter. They move
 around occasionally. A player will come across a rune, and it gives them
 some special ability or quality which helps them. Each player can only have
 one rune at a time (Intentional design), and they lose it when they die.
 Other than that, that's basically the point. See the list of runes below
 and try to familiarize yourself with them. There's a lot, and not all are
 simple. Oh.. and some runes require the use of a button to use whatever
 ability it is. Bind whichever key you wish to use to IMPULSE 100.


 Helpful Instructions:
 ----------------------
[ - IMPULSE 100 or ACTIVATE is "The Button". BIND THIS KEY! If a rune requires
[    a button.. this is it.
[    How to bind "The Button" to the M key:
[       1 - Press the ~ key (next to the 1 key above Q).
[       2 - Type: bind m "impulse 100" (including quotes)
[            or   bind m activate
[ - IMPULSE 99 or SHOW will tell you what rune you currently have.
[ - IMPULSE 98 or DROPRUNE will rid you of your current rune. Not drop it mind
[    you.. just deactivate it.
[ - IMPULSE 97, RUNEHELP, or RUNES Brings up the server blurb again.
[ - IMPULSE 96 or UTURN Does a U-turn.  If you've ever played Duke Nukem, it is the
[    same as the backspace key.
[ - IMPULSE 95, HOOK, +HOOK, or -HOOK Toggles the grappling hook.  Hit it once,
[    it goes out and pulls you up.  You stay attached until the impulse is sent
[    again.  Hitting other players will cause it to stick in them, pull them to
[    you, and do damage the whole time it's hooked.  If you hit other objects,
[    they bounce around from the force of impact and the hook will return
[    immediately.  To prevent the hook from returning immediately, the user
[    needs to setinfo hook to hold.  i.e. "setinfo hook hold".  It does not
[    replace your weapon, so you can pull up and still shoot.
[ - IMPULSE 101 or LIGHT Toggles flash light on and off.
[ - IMPULSEs above 101 and between 20 and 90 will brings up the server
[    blurb again.
  - temp1 in the server.cfg defines the MAX number of runes in the level.
[ - Added system variable "localinfo sr".  Sets starting rune for players.
[    If not set or set to zero "0", players start without any runes and must
[    find their own.  If set to the number of a specific rune (see rune list
[    below), every time a player joins the game or restarts after death they
[    have the specified rune.  0 = no starting rune.  1 - 42 = rune number.  
[    43 - 100 = randomly assigned.
[ - Added system variable "localinfo intangflag".  Determines if a player
[    can pick up item (quad, health, weapons, ammo, etc ...) while intangible.
[    Default value is 0.  Zero means don't pickup.  Any value greater than
[    zero means player can pick up items while intangible.
[ - Added system variable "localinfo cursetime".  Determines if and how long
[    before a player can drop a CURSED rune.  Default value is 0.  Zero means
[    player can not drop cursed rune.  Any value greater than zero is time in
[    seconds before player can drop CURSED rune.
[ - Added system variable "localinfo cloakflag".  Determines if player will
[    use eyes model or be completely invisible while cloaked.  Default value
[    is 0.  Zero means use eyes model.  Any value greater than zero, player
[    is completely invisible.
[ - Added system variable "localinfo darkflag".  Determines if Rune of
[    Darkness will turn out all lights or just ambient lighting.  Default is
[    zero.  Zero equal ambient lighting only.  Any value greater than zero
[    will turn out all lighting.  This includes torches, flickering lights,
[    etc ... 
[ - If samelevel is set to "4", levels are unexitable, and when levels end,
[    the next level is random, which is cool.
[ - If samelevel is set to anything other than "0" when you try to exit, it
[    will rapidly decrease your armor then health as long as you stay in
[    the exit portal.  Normally you would just explode.  The exception is
[    the starting level. Anyone can exit at any time.
[ - Will announce when Quad, Pent, Enviro suit, or Ring of Shadows reappear.
[ - When logging on, a 4 page welcome/help is displayed.  Pressing fire moves
[    to next screen.  After 4th screen player respawns.  While welcome/help
[    screens are shown player is invisible and can not interact with game.
[    They may move around their immediate are.  Only displayed when player
[    first logs on.
[ - If a player suicides more than 5 time within 30 seconds, his name is
[    changed to "Ima Butthead" with a message on their screen saying "You are
[    a Butthead!"
[ - If a player suicides more than 10 time within 30 seconds, they are
[    disconnect.  Their console will then atempt to connect to "www.fbi.gov".
[    The destination can be changed by setting "localinfo op" to the selected
[    other place (op).  Example:  serverinfo op www.id.com:27501
[ - Added throwaxe.mdl for CURSED Rune of the AXE and Vorpal Axe Rune.  It 
[    must go in the "progs" subdirectory (or folder if you prefer) under the 
[    directory you have this mod installed in.  If not, users will not be able
[    to log on.
[ - Added Neutron Bomb Rune.  It will kill all players 20 seconds after pick up
[    unless the holder is killed (he can't suicide), other player is under
[    water, slime, or lava, or other player has Rune of Environmental
[    Protection.  The holder of this rune will be followed by a brightly
[    glowing pentagram.  This is a special rune due to it's destructive force.
[    It is not used unless Admin sets localinfo neutronflag xx.  Default is
[    zero (rune not used).  Any value greater than zero determines how long
[    after the last rune detonated until the next rune is dropped. It is
[    reference to timelimit.  Calculated as timelimit divided neutronflag.
[    Next drop time will not be less than one minute.  If timelimit is not
[    set, it will be on hour or next map until a new Neutron Bomb Rune is
[    dropped.  There will only be one Neutron Bomb Rune on a level at a time.
[    It must be picked up.  It will not be automatically assigned by using
[    localinfo sr.



 Rune List:
 -----------
 1 - Rune of Regeneration - You regenerate your health. If you have armor
      you regenerate that too.
[     Regenerates health to 200 and armor to max for it's type.
[     (BLUE = 100, YELLOW = 150, RED = 200)  Armor still switches if you
[     run over better armor than you presently have.
 2 - Rune of Resistance - You take only 1/2 damage from attacks. Makes the
      invincible sound when damaged.
 3 - Rune of Haste - You shoot all weapons a lot faster than normal. You
      also make a cool growly sound. Lightning gun isn't affected. Nailguns
      shoot nails that move twice as fast.
 4 - Rune of Environmental Protection - Slime and lava GIVE health instead of
      damaging you. Water also gives health if you stay in long enough. The
      Button is Enviro-Jump. When in liquids it makes a high jump upwards.
      This is helpful to get out of the many would-be lava traps. You can't
      drown. You're immune to spike traps, lavaballs, falling real far,
      getting squished, ice traps, death spots, radiation damage, death orbs,
      Electric Rune zaps, and other stuff.
 5 - Berserker Rune - Very simple. You deal 6x damage, you take 3x damage.
       You also bleed a lot.
 6 - Rune of Recall - Press The Button, and your recall point is set. From
      now on, every time The Button is pressed, you'll teleport back to that
      spot. Good for getting out of tough situations into a nice safe place
      to rest. It's almost a porta-camper. Press The Button when on your
      recall point to reset the point.
 7 - Electric Rune - You're electrified! Anyone in a certain radius of you
      gets zapped. You get +10 cells when you get the rune, and each zap it
      does uses a cell. Do NOT jump into the water if you're electrified.
      This would be BAD. Players with Electric rune will flash and have
      bolts flickering around them.
 8  - Rune of Cloaking - You're very quiet and ninja-like. Sneak up
[      on people, shoot 'em, and they'll never hear it. You're dificult
[      to see because you appear as a pair of eyes (like ring of shadows) to
[      other players.  When you shoot or get hurt, you uncloak for a few
[      seconds. VERY stealthy-fun.  Admin may choose to allow total
[      invisibility by setting localinfo cloakflag 1.
 9  - Rune of Divine Wind - Press The Button, and in three clicks you'll
       explode, gibbing ANYONE in sight. If someone kills you before you can
       reach that button, you'll still explode, but the blast won't be as
       powerful. Players with this have a spinny grenade above their head.
 10 - Death Spots - Press The Button to create a death spot. You lose 20
       health. Run away fast, and in a few seconds the spot will become
       invisible. The first person who touches it, explodes. It blows up on
       it's own after a while, but it's more fun just to watch someone run
       into it and spontaeously gib. :)
 11 - Orb of Death - A cool yellow orb (yes, we've seen this effect before)
       rotates around out slowly. It severly bashes anybody who gets in its
       way, besides you. Oh, and when you die.. it might start bouncing
       around aimlessly, lost without its master.
 12 - Rune of Camouflage - Don't move, don't shoot, and they can't see you.
 13 - Rune of Uncontrolable Jumping - Anybody who sees you from a certain
       distance is just so excited, they can't stop jumping!
 14 - Action Movie Arsenal - Your ammo comes from an endless supply. It fills
       up slowly and steadily. When you get all the ammo, you get the
       corresponding ammo.
 15 - Vampiric Rune - You get all of the damage you do in attacks back to
[      you in health.  If the Rune of Darkness is active, you get double
[      the amount of damage back in heath, max health is 200, and can see
[      in shades of red.
 16 - Rune of Shielding - Press The Button, and for a few seconds you're
       invincible. It takes a few seconds to recharge though.       
 17 - Rune of Strength - You deal double damage. 'Nuff said. 
 18 - Rune of Radioactivity - Press The Button, and in 5 seconds the area
       will be irradiated for 45 seconds. Anyone in that area will slowly die
       of radiation poisoning until they move out of the area. You can only
       set three irradiation points at a time, and you can't set one in view
       of another. When you die, you also set radiation points.
 19 - Switch Rune - Aim at another, and press The Button. You'll instantly
       switch places, ammo, health, weapons, and items with them.
 20 - Ice Traps - Much like the Death Spots, you set a spot and in a few
       seconds, stay away from that area. The first unfortunate soul to walk
       there will become frozen for some time. They will be comepletely
       immobile until their time is up, or they're dead.
[21 - Gravity Rune - Press The Button to drop a powerful gravity well that
[      lasts for ten seconds. Requires ten seconds to recharge.  It
[      sucks players in. If they touch the sphere, SPLAT!  They get crushed
[      to death like a black hole.  It does affect you after a five second
[      delay.  So run after dropping.  Press The Button again to remove it
[      before the ten second timer exspires. The gravity wells also
[      affect rockets, nails, ice traps, death spots, and some other stuff.
[      How long it last and how long it takes to recharge can be changed by
[      the system admin by us "localinfo gravsucktime XX" and "localinfo
[      gravrechargetime XX".  Replace "XX" with the time in seconds.
 22 - Impact Rune - All damage you do to someone basically slams them against
       the wall. Big kickback for those hit. It also does slightly more
       damage than normal. You can also slam yourself into an opponent,
       doing them some serious bone cracking.
 23 - Rune of Vengance - Any damage done to you is also done to the attacker.
       People with this rune have a REALLY huge head on them. Scary!
 24 - Shub Hat - This one is silly. It puts a huge rotating Shub over the
       player. It's only use is makes you a little harder to hit, and it's
       distracting. And you can't tell which way the guy is facing. And
       opponents are vulnerable because of their constant laughter.
 25 - Rune of Repulsion - You push back people, rockets, and nifty stuff
       like Death Spots and Ice Traps.
 26 - Rune of Dual Recall - Like recall, but not quite. Press The Button and
       you teleport to the spot you got the rune. Press it again, and you
       teleport to where you teleported last. And so it goes...
 27 - Rune of Weirdness - Ethereal little bubbles float off you. Press The
       Button and you blow one in the direction you're facing. Die, and you
       let off a few as well. If people touch these bubbles, strange
       hallucinogenic things happen to them.
 28 - Phoenix Rune - Three extra lives.  Instead of respawning after you die,
       you come back to life over your previous body, health fully restored,
       all weapons intact, and 15 seconds of Quad power.
[      Fixed a bug that would not let you respawn if you died in any
[      liquid. i.e. lava, slime, and even water.
 29 - Rune of Fire Walking - You leave a harmful trail of fire behind you when
       you run.  Helpful in losing those annoying people who chase you.  Burn
       people's legs off!
 30 - HoloRune - Press The Button and create an image of yourself where you
       stand.  It looks like you, it turns like you, it moves like you, but
       it remains stationary.  Each goes away in about 30 seconds.  You can
       have a maximum of five out at a time.
 31 - Rune of Good Health - You imediately get +100 health. Your maximum
       health becomes 666. Keep getting health box after health box after...
[      Now works in QuakWorld.
[32 - Blink Rune - Press The Button and you'll randomly teleport to a respawn
[      point or teleporter pad.  Players with this rune have a small dot 
[      floating above their head.  Now works in QuakeWorld.


 NEW RUNES:
 ------------
[33 - Rune of Darkness - This one will give you twenty second of darkness when
[      activated.  It becomes night time through out the level.  The bearer
[      of this rune gets a flash light that can be toggled on and off with the
[      active impulse while his/her Rune of Darkness is active.  After rune
[      expires, you must wait twenty seconds before reactivating.
[34 - Anti-missile Rune - You take no damage from rockets or grenades.  It
[      will even push them away like the Rune of Repulsion.  Only rockets
[      and grenades are repelled.  Yes, I know this is a powerful rune
[      since everybody loves to use the rocket launch, but there is a catch.
[      You can not use the grenade or rocket launchers.  Kinda evens things
[      out :)

[CURSED RUNES:]
 -------------
[   That's right, I said CURSED!  Everybody expects only good thing.  The
[world doesn't work that way.  Well at least not my world :).  So I though
[I would make it a little more interestng.  There are only two cursed runes.
[However,there is catch, they can't be dropped!  You must die to get rid of it.
[You can't suicide either.  They will carry over to the next map, if you 
[haven't died when a level ends.  Admin may set a hold time that will allow
[dropping of cursed runes by using localinfo cursetime xx.  xx = seconds
[until dropping allowed.

[35 - CURSED Rune of Attraction! - It's like the Rune of Repulsion in reverse.
[      It pulls everthing that's not nailed down towards you.  This includes
[      your own rounds.  Grenades bounce right back to you.  Rocket travel 
[      slower to target.  If you are running forward and fire a rocket, the 
[      rockect will reverse course, passing behind you to be sling shotted 
[      right into your back.  Ouch! 
[36 - CURSED Rune of the Axe! - Simple, you lose all weapons, but your axe.
[      If you pick up another weapon, it disappears.  Good way to prevent that
[      S.O.B. chasing you from getting it :).  Your ammo count will still
[      increase, giving you slayer plenty of rounds.  You also gain the
[      ability to throw your axe at opponents using impulse 100.  Fire just
[      swings the axe like normal.

[MORE NONCURSED RUNES:]
 ---------------------
[37 - Rune of the Delayed Grenade - Grenades will not explode until you do
[      "impulse 100" or 30 seconds after firing.  When you pick up this rune,
[      you get the grenade launcher and 50 additional grenades.  You can not 
[      launch more than 10 Delayed Grenades.  Prevents you from laying 100 
[      grenades and waiting for a victim. :) 

[38 - Vorpal Axe Rune - If using the axe, you instantly killing your 
[      opponent.  Impulse 100 wil switch your weapon to the axe and throw it.
[      Again, if opponent hit by axe they are instantly killed.
  
[39 - Hell Knight Rune - When activated (impulse 100) shoots streaming fire 
[      balls like Hell Knights do.

[40 - Shooting Star Rune - When activated (impulse 100) shoots a flaming
[     meteor that bounces around doing damage until it burns up.  When it 
[     burns up, it explodes.  If you have quad, it will fly around at four 
[     times it normal speed.

[41 - Rune of Camel Fleas - When you touch someone, you give them a bad case
[     of fleas.  They take five points of health every five seconds without
[     affecting armor.  They can be gotten rid of by jumping in water, slime,
[     or lava (ouch!) or by picking up a megahealth pack.

[42 - Rune of Intangibility - You become totally invisible and invincible for
[     30 seconds, when activated (impulse 100).  However, you can not attack
[     or pick things up while intangible.  It may be deactivated any time, but
[     can not be reactivated for 10 seconds.  Admin may allow picking up items
[     by setting localinfo intangflag 1.

[43 - Myhtril Armor Rune - You automatically get the red armor and it is
[      indestructable.  The armor works like normal, but never drops in value.
[      With red armor, you take 1/4 damage.

[44 - Back Pack Rune - You can carry twice the normal amount of ammo and four
[      medkits.  When rune is picked up, you receive an additional 100 shells,
[      200 nails, 100 rockets, 100 cells, and 4 medkits.  Impulse 100 will
[      use one medkit if your health is less than 100, and display how many
[      medkits are left in the pack.  Touching medkits in the game will
[      restore health as normal unless health is 100 or above.  Then they are
[      added to pack until there are four in it again.

[45 - Thief Rune - You steal something from others each time you bump into
[      them.  If their armor is greater than yours, you take their armor.
[      After armor you take a weapn that's not in use and 5 rounds of ammo.
[      Starting with the lighting gun you work your way down to super shotgun.
[      i.e. lightning gun, rockect launcher, grenade launcher, super nailgun,
[      nailgun, and super shotgun.  If none of the wepons are available or you
[      have them all, you take there ammo.  Starting with cells, rockets, nails
[      and last but not least shells.  You take only what is needed to max that
[      stolen type.  If they have less than is required to max out what you
[      need, you take all but one round.  Oh, a message is sent to the victims
[      letting them know things where stolen.

 Known Bugs:
 ------------
  - If you have more than 100 life and Enviro rune, the life goes to 100. I
     can probably figure this out, but it's 1:09 AM right now, and I'm tired.
[    FIXED
  - Sometimes the Radioactive damage makes players emit telefragging sounds
     rather than pain sounds.  I don't know why!!!
  - Some runes like Camoflage will cause GLQuake to crash if you look in
     one of those mirrors.
  - Rune of Camouflage, when you're standing on a func_train (moving platform)
     and you stop moving to activate the power, it seems that you stop moving
     altogether. But you're really where you should be. Your viewpoint just
     isn't. I doubt this can be fixed.
  - If you have the Rune of Shielding, and are shielded, and jump into the
     "end" exit in the start level, and have noexit on, the game crashes.
[    But that's not my fault.  FIXED


 Planned Stuff:

[         into them.  If their armor is greater than yours, you take their
[         armor.  After armor you take a weapn that's not in use and 5 rounds

[         super shotgun.  i.e. lightning gun, rockect launcher, grenade
[         launcher, super nailgun, nailgun, and super shotgun.  If none of the
[         wepons are available or you have them all, you take there ammo.

[         where stolen.
[       - Modified throwing axe feature for Cursed Rune of the AXE and Vorpal
[         axe to throw the axe at four times it's normal speed when play has
[         Quad.
[       - Added system variable "localinfo grapflag".  Allows admin to disable
[         the grappling hook.  Default value is zero to enable the grappling
[         hook.  "Localinfo grapflag 1" disables the hook.
[       - Added system variable "localinfo respawnmsg".  Determines whether
[         bonus items (quad, ring of shadows, pent, and enviro suit) print
[         messages announcing that they have respawned.  Default is zero for
[         no messages.
[       - Added system variables "localinfo gravsucktime XX" and "localinfo
[         gravrechargetime XX".  These determine how long the Gravity Well
[         last and how long it takes to recharge.  "XX" equals how long in
[         seconds.  If these values are not set, it's 10 seconds stay time
[         and 10 seconds recharge time.
[       - Added system variable "localinfo finalquad". Allows admin to choose
[         whether or not players are give quad damage before timelimit is met.
[         If not set or set to zero, gameplay is normal.  Any value above zero
[         equals the number of seconds before the timelimit that all players
[         are given quad damage until the level expires.  If timelimit is not
[         set, finalquad is ignored.
[       - Added system variable "localinfo runeselect". Allows admin to choose
[         which runes they wish to have in the game or whether to use no runes
[         at all.  Default value is zero (localinfo runeselect 0).  Zero
[         randomly drops all available runes.  One enables only the runes you
[         select via "runeuse.cfg".  Two prevents any runes from being used.
[         The runeuse.cfg file goes in the same directory as the qwprogs.dat
[         file.  It should contain the following lines to enable each rune:

[              Theif Rune
[                   localinfo thief 1
[         If a rune is not listed or the "1" changed to "0", the rune is
[         disabled.  Pay close attention to the spelling.  A copy of
[         runeuse.cfg with all runes enabled is included in the zip file for
[         this mod.  The exception is the Neutron Bomb rune.  It has it's own
[         server variable.  See further down.

[ 2.1.1 - Fixed Phoenix bug that prevented respawning, if you died in liquids.
[       - Fixed Blink Rune.  Randomly teleports to you to a starting point or
[         teleporter pad.
[       - Runes carry over to next level.
[       - Install U-turn, IMPULSE 96.
[       - Installed grappling hook, IMPULSE 95.
[       - Installed flash light for others to use, IMPULSE 101.  Not advertised :)
[       - Added aliases for impulses.
[               impulse 100 = ACTIVATE
[               impulse  99 = SHOW
[               impulse  98 = DROPRUNE
[               impulse  97 = RUNEHELP or RUNES
[               impulse  96 = UTURN
[               impulse  95 = HOOK, +HOOK, or -HOOK
[               impulse 101 = LIGHT
[       - Added a 3 page welcome/help is displayed.  Pressing fire moves to
[         next screen.  After 3rd screen player respawns.  While welcome/help
[         screens are shown player is invisible and can not interact with game.
[         They may move around their immediate are.  Only displayed when player
[         first logs on.
[       - Added "serverinfo" variable "sr".  Allows server admin to select a
[         starting rune for players.  0 = no starting rune.  1 - 42 = rune 
[         number.  43 - 100 = randomly assigned.
[       - Added antisuicide mod.  If a palyer suicides more than 5 times within
[         30 seconds, their name is changed to "Ima Butthead" with the message
[         "You're a Butthead" displayed on their screen.  If they suicide more
[         than 10 times within 30 seconds, they are disconnected.  Their
[         console will try to connect to www.fbi.gov.  The destination may be
[         changed by setting "serverinfo" variable "op" (other place) to the
[         destination of your choice.  Example: serverinfo op www.id.com:27501
[       - Added grappling hook.  Uses impulse 95 to launch and release.  It 
[         will hook to any solid structure and pull you to it.  Hitting other
[         players will cause it to stick in them, pull them to you, and do
[         damage the whole time it's hooked.  If you hit other objects, they
[         bounce around from the force of impact.
[       - Fixed Rune of Environmental Protection.  Can now get healt above 100
[         from megahealth packs.
[       - Can drop runes immediately.
[       - Changed Gravity Well.
[               - Acts more like a black hole.  Touch it, go splat!
[               - Last only 10 seconds.
[               - Requires recharge of 10 seconds.
[               - Affects owner after 5 seconds delay.
[                 (no more Gravity Well campers :p)
[       - Modified Rune of Regeneration to regenerate health to 200 and armor 
[         to max for it's particular type.
[       - Enabled Rune of Good Health.  Was disabled before.  Fixed max health
[         to 666.  Would not go above 250 after a level change.
[       - If the Rune of Darkness is active, Vampire Rune gives you back health
[         equal to twice the damage you do to your victim and see in shades of
[         red.
[       - Teleporters don't blow you up when you try to exit with "noexit" set.
[         It rapidly decrease your armor until depleted then your health so 
[         long as you remain in the teleporter.
[       - Fixed gravity for e1m8 to match regular Quake.  It's like walking on
[         the moon.
[       - Will announce when Quad, Pent, Enviro suit, or Ring of Shadows 
[         reappears.
[       - Teleporters teleport rounds.  So you can shoot people after they go
[         through the telporter.
[       - Added Anti-missile Rune.  Makes you invulnerable to missiles and
[         grenades.  Will even repel them like the Rune of Repulsion.  However,
[         you are no longer able to use the grenade or rocket launchers.
[       - Added Rune of Darkness.  When activated entire level goes dark.  
[         Lamps  and torches still work.  Owner of rune gets a flashlight that
[         can be  toggled on/off by the rune activate impulse.  20 seconds of 
[         darkness with 20 seconds of recharge before reactivating.
[       - Added CURSED Rune of Attraction.  Like Rune of Repulsion in reverse.
[         Pulls everything that's not nailed down towards you, including your
[         own grenades and rockets.  Can't be dropped.  Must die to get rid of
[         it.  Will carry over to next level.
[       - Added CURSED Rune of the AXE.  You loose all weapons except the axe.
[         When you pick up a weapon it disappears.  Can't be dropped.  Must die
[         to get rid of it.  Will carry over to next level.
[       - Added Rune of the Delayed Grenaded.  Works similar to pipe bombs in 
[         Duke Nukem 3D(tm).  Grenades will not explode until 30 seconds later
[         or you press the button (impulse 100).  They also act like mines.  
[         If someone should step on them they explode.
[       - Added Vorpal Axe Rune.  The axe instantly kills your opponent.
[         (D&D inspiration from vorpal sword)
[       - Added Hell Knight Rune.  You shoot stings of little fire balls like
[         the Hell Knights in the game do.
[       - Added Shooting Star Rune.  You shoot out a flaming meteor that 
[         bounces around doing damage.  Explodes when it burns up.  Quadruple 
[         speed if you have quad.
[       - Added Rune of Camel Fleas.  When you touch someone, you give them a 
[         bad case of fleas.  They take five points of health every five 
[         seconds without affecting armor.  They can be gotten rid of by 
[         jumping in water, slime, or lava (ouch!) or by picking up a 
{         megahealth pack.
[       - Added Rune of Intangibility.  You become totally invisible and
[         invincible for 30 seconds, when activated (impulse 100).  However, 
[         you can not attack or pick things up while intangible.  It may be 
[         deactivated any time, but can not be reactivated for 10 seconds.


  2.1 - I don't know the exact specs, but servers with teamplay on would
         crash with deathspots a lot. This is somehow fixed. :) Fixed
         firewalking a bit, but only for the LAN version. Oh, and added
         the "noexit 3" option for random level selection.

  2.0 - FINAL VERSION! (or is it?)
        Action Movie Ammo now gives weapons and is Action Movie Arsenal.

  1.99d - Oops! Forgot some stuff.
  1.99c - Getting closer. Phased Rune.

  1.99 - Bug fixes. New effects.

  1.98 - Beserker Rune, Phoenix Rune

  1.96 - Death Orb will now ALWAYS be there when owner dies. I think.
         I think I fixed the Radioactive messages for the killer of a
          radioactive guy.

  1.93 - Won't be a grapple hook. Too much lag I think.
         Rune of Weirdness made less powerful.

  1.92 - "Rune of Dual Recall" added
         "Rune of Weirdness" added
         Grav rune can hurt people. This is kinda a test though.

  1.91 - Still not at 2.0, which WILL be the final version for a couple months.
         Fire Walk and Spiky Cloud should be less laggy now.
         Blink rune no longer uses cells.
         Now, if you recall when ON your spot, you'll un-set your point, so
          you can set it somewhere else.
         No more silence rune. I blended it with the Rune of Cloaking, which
          has always had the code there, but I never used it until now.

  1.9 - Runes needed to spawn faster.
        The grapple hook code is in there. I personally like the grapple hook,
         but I don't really want it in Artifact. Yet many people have asked
         for it, so I'm releasing two versions. One with and one without the
         grapple hook. The code is in BOTH versions, just disabled in one.

  1.83 - Minor tweaking
         Shambler Helper doesn't carry 1/10th of damage to its owner any more.
         Made Shamblers less passive and more agressive.
         Fixed that never-leave-water bug with Rune of Flight.
         Fixed that didn't-lose-my-weapon bug with Switch Rune.
         Added a "body-check" to impact rune.
         Added a kinda TWEAK your neck thing to impact rune.
         Made all the text for "You got..." appear near the bottom.
         Rune of haste fires really fast nails instead of firing nails fast.

  1.82 - Fixed Jump Rune
         Minor tweaking
         Added "Shambler Helper". I know, there's a LOT of work to be done
          on it. Too many bugs.
         Added "Rune of Floating Spiky Death Cloud". I'm afraid it COULD
          cause a lot of lag. I might have to tweak it.
         Rune of Flight is much different now. Much better.

  1.81 - Rebalanced some stuff!
         Made the Death Orb go boingboingboing after owner is killed.
         Added "Shub Hat". It's real silly and I might remove it.
         Added "Rune of Repulsion". Is it too strong?
         Added "Rune of Vengance". I love the huge head.
         Runes no longer fall in lava!
         For now, you gotta keep a rune for at least 5 seconds.
         Improved rune counting format for levels. More accurate number of
          runes in level that you want.

  1.8 - Out of beta!
        Seriously weakened the gravity rune. I hope so at least. It
         was waaay too strong. Actually, it pulls things harder now, just
         players now have better traction against the ground.

  1.7b - Added the "Impact Rune". Is it too weak?
         Electric and Death Spots crippled more.
         Gravity tweaked.

  1.6b - Added the Push for the Rune of Flight. Makes it more manuverable.
         Fixed some MAJOR problems with how the Switch Rune would switch
          items like Quad. This is untested, but I think the last version
          would have screwed up, and the current one shouldn't.
         Fixed the thing how I screwed up the Rune of Uncontrollable Jumping
          in the last version.

  1.5b - Added "The Teleport Shuffle"
         Rune of Environmental protection protects from even more now.
         Added Enviro-Jump to the above rune. It WAS necessary.
         Fixed more client obituary bugs.
         Various runes crippled or less crippled.
         Switch runes now switch health, ammo, and weapons. Too powerful??
         Gravity rune was totally changed. It can actually be fun now.

  1.4b - Added "Gravity Rune". Is this thing too annoying?
         RuneServ is no longer in deathmatch mode 3. It's just deathmatch.
          I have no idea why I had it that way.
         Fixed the bug with how not all in a group are affected by
          Uncontrollable jumping or Radioactivity.
         Fixed the "Everlasting Death" with the pentagram + Divine Wind.
         Death Spots seemed a little too cheap. Now you can only have 4 and
          they take 20 health.

  1.3b - Added "Ice Traps".
         Added the "Switch Rune".
         The Rune of Fire Walking was not doing ANY damage before. It's
          rather deadly now, and I made the flames bigger. Huhhh huh, fire.
         The fakes from the Holorune no longer disappear when the owner
          dies. This wasn't hard to do, I just didn't want to do it until now.

  1.2b - Quick change. Rune of Radioactivity makes a little explody thingy
          when it goes active.

  1.1b - I was right! }:P If you dropped the Rune of Shielding when you're
          shielded, you'd be invincible forever. Forgot to fix that.

  1.0b - Whee! I added the Rune of Radioactivity. Untested for playability,
          but I hope people like it.
         I fixed a couple bugs I missed before.
         Runes don't make spawny sounds when moving around.

  0.9b - First public release.
         Added the last 4 runes (so they're not tested for balance in
          deathmatch).
         Fixed some client obituaries.

  0.1b - Preprepre beta. Tested it at a local LAN party. Went smooth.
